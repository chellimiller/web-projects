# Color App

App to create color palettes, convert colors to different formats, and compare colors.

Will this ever be finished? Probably not. Fun experiment though.  I'd like to make this a PWA and use this as a learning experience.

Not sure what the scope of this app will be yet.

I'm toying around with the following ideas:
 - Material UI palette builder
 - Ability to demonstrate palettes on light and dark themes
 - Calculating contrasts and perhaps suggesting better alternatives to a color

In the end, this may just be a simple app that just converts colors and is available offline.
